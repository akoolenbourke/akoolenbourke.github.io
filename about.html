        <p>Born in 1971, I live in Auckland, New Zealand. I have a wife and 2 kick arse kids.</p>
        
        <p>Loved computers and programming since I saw my first computer on telly in the early 80's (SpectraVideo 318). 
            The idea that I could possibly build a game that I'd only seen in the arcades just blew me away and I got myself an afterschool job until I could afford one. 
            After a while I then saved up enough to turn that 32K of RAM into 96K!

        <p>As an electronics newb, I've recently embarked on a DIY CPU/Computer project of the likes of <a href="https://eater.net/8bit">Ben Eater</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@weirdboyjim">James Sharman</a></p>
        <p>I'm also embarking on a personal project to upskill my C++ to C++ 20, 23 and beyond by building a collection of game-related algorithms and datastructures. 
        It will be on my <a href="https://github.com/akoolenbourke">github</a> when I have a few things ready but it's early days yet.</p>

        <div>I'm one of those smelly vegan hippies (OK, I don't smell) turning vegan in 1990 well before most people knew what it was. Seeing how massive the movement has grown as people identify
             with animal suffering, the planet dying and the health benefits from eating more plants is beyond words. I was an animal rights activist in the 90's and proud to be part of the
            group that performed one the first NZ animal-rights related civil disobedience lockdown.
            <p>I founded and ran <a class ="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MeatFreeMedia">Meat Free Media</a>, a small group of one where I used video to raise awareness of animal rights in New Zealand.

            If you feel inclined, check out and support any of these groups.
